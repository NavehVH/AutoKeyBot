# AutoKeyBot

**AutoKeyBot** is a Windows Forms application written in C# that automates gameplay based on user-defined logic. It offers two primary modes of operation:

### Regular Bot Mode
Configure how the player behaves in response to in-game events using an intuitive UI with built-in features.

### Script Bot Mode
Write and compile your own custom code using the provided **Botting API**, allowing for more flexible and high-performance behavior based on game data.

## How It Works

AutoKeyBot simulates keystrokes using the Windows API to control the player in-game. It gathers in-game information by analyzing pixel data from the screen, enabling it to detect:

- Player position  
- Presence of other players on the map  
- Health levels  
- Additional in-game status

All components run concurrently using multithreading, enabling smooth and responsive automation.

With access to real-time game data, you can create complex behaviors triggered by conditions such as:

- Player position  
- Time-based events  
- Health thresholds  
- Any custom condition you define
